# Python Calculator Collection
This is a collection of programs I wrote during maths lessons, for calculating topics that we were studying. 

I would write a program at the start of a lesson, then use the program to help me throughout the topic. 
Most programs were written or updated on my calculator (CX II-T CAS, contact me for .tns files).

The mathematical accuracy of these programs should be okay, but is NOT guaranteed. If you notice that something is incorrect, please submit an issue or pull request.

Programs will be added and updated.
