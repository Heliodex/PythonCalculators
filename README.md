# Python Calculator Collection
This is a collection of programs I wrote during maths lessons, for calculating topics that we were studying. 

I would write a program at the start of a lesson, then use the program to help me throughout the topic. 
Most programs were written or updated on my calculator, denoted by the "calc" following the date at the top of each program.

Programs will be added and updated.

The programs are licensed under the Apache 2 license.
