# Python Calculator Collection
This is a collection of programs I wrote during maths lessons, for calculating topics that we were studying. 

I would write a program at the start of a lesson, then use the program to help me throughout the topic. 

Programs will be added and updated.

The programs are licensed under the Apache 2 license.
